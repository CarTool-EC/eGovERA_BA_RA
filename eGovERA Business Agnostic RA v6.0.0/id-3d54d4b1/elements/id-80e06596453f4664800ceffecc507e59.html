It provides a framework for establishing data sovereignty and control, allowing organizations to share and collaborate on data while maintaining ownership and privacy. The IDSC facilitates the seamless integration of data from various sources, ensuring interoperability and enabling the creation of data ecosystems.

Additional information: The International Data Space Connector is a software component that acts as a mediator between data providers and data consumers. It ensures secure and trusted data exchange by implementing authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms. The IDSC enables organizations to define and enforce access control policies, ensuring that data is only shared with authorized parties. It also supports data discovery and metadata management, allowing organizations to easily find and understand available data resources. The IDSC promotes data sovereignty by enabling organizations to retain control over their data, even when sharing it with external partners. It provides a scalable and flexible solution for data exchange, supporting various data formats and communication protocols. The IDSC is a key enabler for the creation of data ecosystems, where organizations can collaborate and innovate based on shared data resources.

Example: An example of the International Data Space Connector in action is in the manufacturing industry. Multiple organizations, such as suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics providers, can securely exchange data related to production processes, quality control, and supply chain management. By using the IDSC, these organizations can collaborate and optimize their operations based on real-time data insights. For instance, a manufacturer can securely share production data with a supplier, allowing them to adjust their inventory levels based on demand forecasts. This seamless data exchange facilitated by the IDSC leads to improved efficiency, reduced costs, and enhanced decision-making across the entire value chain.
