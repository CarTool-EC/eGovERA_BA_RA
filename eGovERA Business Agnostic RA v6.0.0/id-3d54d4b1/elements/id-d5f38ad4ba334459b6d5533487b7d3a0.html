						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">Description: Red Hat OpenShift is a container application platform that enables developers to build, deploy, and manage applications across various cloud environments. It provides a consistent and secure foundation for developing and scaling applications, allowing teams to focus on delivering value rather than managing infrastructure. OpenShift utilizes Kubernetes orchestration to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Additional information: Red Hat OpenShift simplifies the process of developing, deploying, and scaling applications by providing a comprehensive platform that abstracts away the underlying infrastructure complexities. It offers a self-service environment for developers to easily create and deploy applications using containers, which encapsulate the application and its dependencies. OpenShift provides features like automated scaling, load balancing, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, enabling teams to rapidly iterate and deliver software. It also offers built-in security features, such as role-based access control (RBAC) and image scanning, to ensure the integrity and compliance of applications. With its support for multiple cloud providers and on-premises environments, OpenShift offers flexibility and portability for applications across different infrastructures.

Example: An example of using Red Hat OpenShift is a development team building a microservices-based application. They can leverage OpenShift to create and manage containers for each microservice, allowing independent development and scaling of individual components. OpenShift's built-in CI/CD capabilities enable automated testing and deployment of new versions, ensuring a streamlined development process. The team can easily scale the application horizontally by adding more container instances as needed, and OpenShift's load balancing features distribute the traffic efficiently. With OpenShift's portability, the team can seamlessly deploy the application across different cloud providers or on-premises environments, adapting to changing business needs.
