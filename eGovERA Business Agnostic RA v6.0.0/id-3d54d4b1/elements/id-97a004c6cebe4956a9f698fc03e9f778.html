						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">Description: OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service, such as Facebook, GitHub, and DigitalOcean. It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts the user account, and authorizing third-party applications to access the user account. OAuth 2.0 focuses on client developer simplicity while providing specific authorization flows for web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, and living room devices.

Additional information: OAuth 2.0 (Open Authorization 2.0) is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords. It is a protocol that allows a user to grant a third-party website or application access to their personal information, without needing to share their credentials.

OAuth 2.0 is the successor to OAuth 1.0, which was designed to solve the problem of having to share passwords with third-party applications. OAuth 2.0 improves upon the original OAuth protocol by simplifying the client-side development experience, and providing specific authorization flows for web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, and living room devices.

OAuth 2.0 works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts the user account, and authorizing third-party applications to access the user account. OAuth 2.0 defines a protocol for this interaction, which involves several steps. First, the user is authenticated by the service hosting the user account, and then authorizes the third-party application to access specific details from their account. The third-party application is then provided with an access token, which it can use to access the user's account.

OAuth 2.0 is used in a wide variety of applications, including providing a "log in with Facebook" or "log in with Google" functionality on websites, or authorizing applications to access services like Google Drive or iCloud on a user's behalf. It is a crucial part of the modern web, and understanding how it works can be very useful for anyone developing web applications.

Example: 1. Google Sign-In: Google uses OAuth 2.0 to allow users to log into third-party websites or applications using their Google account credentials. This saves users from having to remember another username and password, and it also provides the third-party app with a secure way to access the user's Google account data that they have given permission to access.

2. Facebook Login: Similar to Google, Facebook also uses OAuth 2.0 to allow users to log into third-party websites or applications using their Facebook account credentials. The third-party app can also access the user's Facebook data with their permission.

3. GitHub: GitHub uses OAuth 2.0 to allow third-party applications to access a user's GitHub data. For example, a developer might use a third-party app to manage their GitHub repositories, and OAuth 2.0 would be used to authenticate the user and authorize the app to access their data.

4. Dropbox: Dropbox uses OAuth 2.0 to allow third-party apps to access a user's Dropbox account. For example, a photo editing app might use OAuth 2.0 to access a user's photos stored in Dropbox.

5. Slack: Slack uses OAuth 2.0 to allow third-party apps to access a user's Slack workspace. For example, a project management app might use OAuth 2.0 to access a user's Slack messages and channels.

6. Microsoft Azure: Microsoft Azure uses OAuth 2.0 to authenticate users and allow third-party applications to access Azure resources. For example, a monitoring tool might use OAuth 2.0 to access Azure metrics and logs.

7. Spotify: Spotify uses OAuth 2.0 to allow third-party applications to access a user's Spotify data. For example, a music recommendation app might use OAuth 2.0 to access a user's Spotify playlists and listening history.
