This community is part of the larger Gaia-X project, which is a European endeavor to establish a competitive, secure, and trustworthy data infrastructure for Europe.

								The Gaia-X Data Spaces Community is composed of various stakeholders, including businesses, research institutions, public sector organizations, and other interested parties. These stakeholders work together to define the requirements, standards, and rules for data spaces, which are virtual environments where data can be shared and exchanged in a secure and controlled manner.

								The community's main goal is to create a framework for data spaces that ensures data sovereignty and data availability. Data sovereignty refers to the idea that data is subject to the laws and governance structures of the country in which it is located. Data availability, on the other hand, refers to the ability to access and use data when and where it is needed.

								The Gaia-X Data Spaces Community is organized into several working groups, each focusing on a specific aspect of data spaces. These working groups include the Data Spaces Architecture and Standards Working Group, the Data Spaces Use Cases and Requirements Working Group, and the Data Spaces Governance and Certification Working Group.

								The community also collaborates with other Gaia-X communities and working groups, as well as with external organizations and initiatives. This collaboration is crucial for ensuring that the data spaces framework is compatible with other components of the Gaia-X infrastructure and with the broader data ecosystem.

								In summary, the Gaia-X Data Spaces Community is a collaborative initiative that aims to create a secure, trustworthy, and federated data infrastructure in Europe. It brings together various stakeholders to define the requirements, standards, and rules for data spaces, with the goal of ensuring data sovereignty and data availability.</td></tr>
