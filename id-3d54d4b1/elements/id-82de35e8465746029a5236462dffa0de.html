Additional information: Continuous Security Monitoring is a concept in IT architecture that involves the continuous monitoring of an organization's IT infrastructure to detect and respond to security threats in real-time. This approach involves the use of automated tools and processes to monitor network traffic, system logs, and other data sources for signs of suspicious activity. The goal of continuous security monitoring is to identify potential security incidents as early as possible, so that they can be addressed before they can cause significant damage to the organization. This approach is becoming increasingly important as the number and complexity of security threats continue to grow, and as organizations become more reliant on technology to support their operations.

Example: Continuous Security Monitoring:
Decision: Implementing security monitoring tools and processes to continuously monitor and detect security incidents and vulnerabilities.
Rationale: Continuous security monitoring helps identify and respond to security threats promptly, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, or service disruptions.

dct:title: Architecture Decision Record about Continous Security Monitoring

eira:adr_context: The context explains why we need to make a decision. It also describes the alternatives along with the pros and cons.

eira:adr_decision: The decision describes the justification for why the particular solution was accepted. It has more emphasis on the why rather than the how.

eira:adr_status: [Proposed (under review)|Accepted (approved and ready for implementation)|Superseded (superseded by another decision)]

eira:adr_consecuences: The consequences section contains information about the overall impact of an architectural decision. Every decision has trade-offs. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s crucial to include the analysis to provide a clear picture.
