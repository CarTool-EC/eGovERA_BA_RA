These legislative instruments aim to harmonize and modernize various sectors including electronic communications, digital content and services, public procurement, insurance distribution, payment services, cross-border parcel delivery services, cross-border payments, geo-blocking, and electronic commerce within the European Union (EU). The purpose of these legislations is to promote transparency, competition, innovation, consumer protection, and fair trade practices across the EU's internal market.

Additional information: The EBI catalogue includes various directives and regulations that govern different sectors within the EU. These legislative instruments have been enacted with the aim of harmonizing rules and regulations across member states, promoting competition and innovation, protecting consumer rights, and ensuring fair trade practices. They cover a wide range of areas including electronic communications, digital content and services, public procurement, insurance distribution, payment services, cross-border parcel delivery services, cross-border payments, geo-blocking, and electronic commerce. Each legislation has specific objectives and requirements that must be adhered to by the relevant stakeholders.

Example: For instance, Directive (EU) 2018/1972, also known as the European Electronic Communications Code, modernizes and harmonizes the regulatory framework for electronic communications across the EU. On the other hand, Directive (EU) 2019/770 focuses on contracts for the provision of digital content and digital services, aiming to strengthen consumer rights in the digital market. Similarly, Regulation (EU) 2018/302, known as the Geo-blocking Regulation, addresses unjustified geo-blocking and other forms of discrimination based on customers' nationality or location within the internal market.
