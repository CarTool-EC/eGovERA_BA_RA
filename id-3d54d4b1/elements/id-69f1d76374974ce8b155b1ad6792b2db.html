It is designed to provide a wide range of information and resources related to data spaces, which are virtual environments where organizations can share, exchange, and work with data.

								The Knowledge Base is a part of the JRC's broader initiative to support the development and implementation of data spaces in Europe, in line with the European strategy for data. It aims to facilitate the understanding, design, and operation of data spaces by providing a variety of resources, including technical guides, policy documents, case studies, and research papers.

								The JRC Data Spaces Knowledge Base covers a wide range of topics related to data spaces, including data governance, data interoperability, data infrastructure, and data sharing. It also provides information on various aspects of data spaces, such as their architecture, legal and ethical considerations, and potential applications in different sectors.

								The Knowledge Base is intended for a wide range of users, including policymakers, data professionals, researchers, and businesses. It aims to support these users in making informed decisions about the design and implementation of data spaces, and to promote the sharing and reuse of data in a secure and trustworthy manner.

								In addition to providing information and resources, the JRC Data Spaces Knowledge Base also serves as a platform for dialogue and collaboration. It encourages users to contribute their own knowledge and experiences, and to engage in discussions and collaborations with other users. This collaborative approach is intended to foster a vibrant and dynamic community of practice around data spaces, and to support the ongoing development and evolution of data spaces in Europe.</td></tr>
