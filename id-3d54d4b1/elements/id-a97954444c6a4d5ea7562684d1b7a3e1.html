This view associates the Agnostic Datasets with the Business Information Base and Digital Public Services from the application layer.Within this view, Agnostic Datasets represent standardized collections of data that are independent of specific business domains. These datasets adhere to common data structures, formats, and semantics, enabling interoperability, data integration, and efficient data exchange across different digital services and applications.The Business Information Base, as part of the application layer, serves as a repository of business-related information that utilizes the Agnostic Datasets. It stores and manages domain-specific data within the standardized dataset structures, facilitating data consistency, accessibility, and sharing.Digital Public Services leverage the Agnostic Datasets to ensure uniformity and coherence in data representation and utilization. These services align their data models, operations, and interactions with the agnostic datasets, enabling seamless integration, data consistency, and semantic interoperability among different digital public services.By associating the Agnostic Datasets with the Business Information Base and Digital Public Services, the "Semantic view - Business Agnostic Datasets" promotes standardized data management practices and efficient data utilization within the digital ecosystem. This view supports data integration, semantic interoperability, and advanced functionalities for digital public services.The agnostic nature of the datasets allows for flexibility and adaptability across different business domains and digital public services. It enables reusability of data structures, reduces data duplication, and promotes consistent data representation and exchange.
