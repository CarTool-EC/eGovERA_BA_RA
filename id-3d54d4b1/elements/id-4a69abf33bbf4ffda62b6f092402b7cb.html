It involves collecting data, analyzing it in real-time, and generating alerts or reports to ensure that everything is functioning optimally. Monitoring helps identify issues, troubleshoot problems, and make informed decisions to improve the overall performance and reliability of IT infrastructure.

Additional information: Monitoring is a critical aspect of IT management as it allows organizations to proactively identify and address potential issues before they escalate. It involves the use of specialized tools and technologies to continuously collect and analyze data from various sources such as servers, databases, network devices, and applications. This data is then used to generate real-time alerts, performance reports, and visualizations that provide insights into the health and performance of the IT environment. Monitoring can encompass various aspects, including system availability, resource utilization, network traffic, security events, application performance, and user experience.

Example: An example of monitoring in practice is the monitoring of a web server. By continuously monitoring metrics such as CPU usage, memory utilization, network traffic, and response times, IT administrators can identify potential bottlenecks or performance issues. They can set up alerts to be notified if any of these metrics exceed predefined thresholds. Monitoring can also help track website availability and response times from different geographical locations, ensuring a positive user experience. Additionally, monitoring can provide valuable insights into user behavior, allowing organizations to optimize their websites or applications based on usage patterns and trends.
