These solutions are designed to be adaptable and flexible, allowing businesses from different sectors to conform to the same set of standards or regulations.

Additional information: These solutions are typically software or digital services that provide tools and features to help businesses manage and monitor their compliance with various regulations. They may include features for risk management, audit trails, reporting, and more. The 'agnostic' aspect refers to the fact that these solutions are not tied to any specific business or industry - they can be used by any type of business that needs to comply with certain regulations. This makes them highly versatile and useful for businesses operating in highly regulated industries, such as finance, healthcare, and more.

Example: Examples of Business Agnostic Conformance Solutions could include compliance management software like LogicGate or Onspring. These platforms provide tools for risk management, compliance, audit management, and more, and can be used by businesses in any industry. Another example could be a digital service that provides a platform for businesses to manage and monitor their GDPR compliance, which would be applicable to any business that handles personal data of EU citizens.
