These instruments aim to harmonize rules and regulations across EU member states, promote fair competition and innovation, protect consumer rights, and ensure the security and privacy of electronic transactions. The EBI includes directives, regulations, and proposals that address issues related to governance, behavioural, and structural interoperability.

Additional information: The European Binding Instruments (EBI) catalogue includes a variety of legislative and regulatory instruments that govern different aspects of interoperability within the digital single market of the European Union. These instruments are grouped into three categories: Legislation on Governance Interoperability, Legislation on Behavioural Interoperability, and Legislation on Structural Interoperability. Each category includes a number of specific instruments, such as directives and regulations, that address specific issues related to electronic communications, digital content and services, public procurement, insurance distribution, payment services, cross-border parcel delivery services, geo-blocking, electronic commerce, open data, data protection, free flow of non-personal data, web accessibility, electronic invoicing, cybersecurity, and electronic identification and trust services.

Example: An example of a European Binding Instrument is the Directive (EU) 2018/1972, also known as the European Electronic Communications Code. This directive aims to modernize and harmonize the regulatory framework for electronic communications across the European Union. It sets out rules and obligations for electronic communications services, networks, and infrastructure providers, with the goal of promoting competition, investment, and innovation in the sector. Another example is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is a regulation enacted by the European Union in 2016 to protect the privacy and personal data of individuals within the EU. It establishes rules and guidelines for the processing of personal data by organizations, including the collection, storage, and transfer of such data.
