Additional information: An Infrastructure Architect is a key role in the field of information technology. This professional is responsible for designing, implementing, and managing the infrastructure of an organization's IT landscape. The infrastructure typically includes hardware, software, networks, data centers, and various services. 

The Infrastructure Architect's primary responsibility is to ensure that all aspects of an organization's technical systems align with its business goals. They are involved in every phase of a system's lifecycle, from initial design through implementation, maintenance, and eventual retirement or replacement.

The Infrastructure Architect's role involves a wide range of tasks. They must analyze the current state of the organization's infrastructure, identify weaknesses or inefficiencies, and propose improvements. They also need to stay current with the latest technologies and trends in IT infrastructure, and determine how these could be applied to benefit the organization.

In addition, the Infrastructure Architect must work closely with other IT professionals, such as network engineers, system administrators, and software developers, to ensure that all components of the infrastructure work together seamlessly. They also need to coordinate with business leaders and stakeholders to understand their needs and ensure that the infrastructure supports them.

The Infrastructure Architect is also responsible for creating and maintaining documentation of the infrastructure, including diagrams, specifications, and policies. They may also be involved in training staff on the use and maintenance of the infrastructure.

In terms of skills, an Infrastructure Architect needs a deep understanding of various technologies, including servers, storage systems, networks, and software applications. They also need strong problem-solving skills, the ability to think strategically, and excellent communication skills. A degree in computer science or a related field, as well as several years of experience in IT, are typically required for this role.
