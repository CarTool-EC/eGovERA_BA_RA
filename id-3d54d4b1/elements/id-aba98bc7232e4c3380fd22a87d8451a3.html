These measures aim to facilitate the exchange of information and services between public sector entities, enhance cybersecurity, ensure the protection of personal data, and promote fair competition in the digital economy.

Additional information: The EBI catalogue includes various directives, regulations, and proposals that address different aspects of behavioural interoperability. These include the Open Data Directive, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Regulation on the free flow of non-personal data, the Single Digital Gateway Regulation, the Web Accessibility Directive, the Directive on electronic invoicing in public procurement, the Cyber Solidarity Act Proposal, the NIS2 Directive, the Digital Services Act, the Interoperable Europe Act Proposal, the Artificial Intelligence Act Proposal, the Digital Service Act (DSA), the Cyber Resilience Act Proposal, the Data Governance Act, the Implementing Act on High-Value Datasets, and the Digital Markets Act. Each of these measures contributes to the overall goal of promoting interoperability, data sharing, and data protection across the EU.

Example: For instance, the Open Data Directive sets minimum requirements for making public sector information available for re-use, while the GDPR establishes rules for the processing of personal data. The Regulation on the free flow of non-personal data promotes data sharing and portability, and the Single Digital Gateway Regulation aims to simplify access to public services and information online. The Web Accessibility Directive ensures that digital platforms are accessible to all individuals, including those with disabilities, and the Directive on electronic invoicing in public procurement promotes efficiency and interoperability in public procurement processes. The Cyber Solidarity Act Proposal strengthens the EU's ability to respond to cybersecurity threats, and the NIS2 Directive boosts the overall level of cybersecurity in the EU. The Digital Services Act creates a single market for digital services, the Interoperable Europe Act Proposal promotes the seamless exchange of data and information between public sector entities, and the Artificial Intelligence Act Proposal regulates the use of AI in the EU. The Digital Service Act (DSA) updates the EU's legal framework for illegal content on intermediaries, the Cyber Resilience Act Proposal establishes cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements, the Data Governance Act establishes a framework for the governance of data, the Implementing Act on High-Value Datasets describes datasets held by the public sector, and the Digital Markets Act ensures fair and contestable markets in the digital sector.
